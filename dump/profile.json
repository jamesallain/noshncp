The collection of this data can then be used to encourage citizens, government agencies, community groups, media and civic organizations to work together to stabilize, improve, maintain, grow and take pride in their community. \n\nAmong many solutions at EC is our SmartCity311 mobile application, which is a city branded mobile \u0026 cloud-based system, based on the Open311 protocols that citizens can use to report their non-emergency civic issues to government. \n\nExamples of our such apps are Ahmedabad-311, Bhavnagar-311, Karnali-311 and Varanasi-311 just to name a few.
